This is the holding folder for configs for different axis specific to your printer. when uploading, paste the json into [../data/config.json]

JSON format:

{
    "axis": [
        {
            "id": ,
            "motors": [{
                "pins":,
                "direction":,
                "maxpos":,
                "steplen":,
                "stepsPerRev":
            }],
            "sensor": {sensor specific info}
        }
    ]
}

axis: an array of axis for the esp to control. Can be any length, as long as the esp has the pins

id: the axis id. current support for x, y, z, e. modify
[](movecommand::coords), main::axismap and main::AXIS to add more

motors: an array of stepper motors that drive the axis. Can be any length

pins: array of 2 pin that connect to the motor driver [direction, step]

direction: which direction the motor considers forward. Can be fwd or rev. Fwd is counterclockwise

maxpos: the maximum position the axis can be at.

steplen: how many steps it takes to move a millimeter based on your axis control method

stepsPerRev: how many steps the motor needs to complete a revolution

sensor: the data for the leveling sensor
supported sensors: CRTouch, limit switch, no sensor.
see [sensors](../include/sensors.h) for sensor specific data
